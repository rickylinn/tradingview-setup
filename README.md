ðŸŽ¯ TradingView Custom Config

This is my personal TradingView setup to make charting easier and more comfortable.

## What's Included:
- Custom chart colors (dark and light themes)
- Saved drawing tools like trendlines and Fibonacci
- Favorite indicators (EMA, RSI, VWAP)
- Layout and shortcut settings

## How to Use:
Just open the files and manually apply the settings in your TradingView account. Useful for keeping your chart clean and consistent.

## Note:
TradingView doesn't support full import, so everything needs to be set up manually.
